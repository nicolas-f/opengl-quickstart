# OpenGL Quickstart for Apple Silicon

A streamlined OpenGL setup and 3D scene viewer optimized for Apple Silicon Macs. This project eliminates the configuration challenges of OpenGL on modern macOS systems through intelligent scripting and architecture detection.

## Key Features

- Automated OpenGL setup specifically optimized for Apple Silicon
- Architecture detection for correct library installation
- Compatible with multiple C++ compilers (Clang, GCC, system default)
- Interactive 3D scene with camera and object manipulation
- Complete lighting system with configurable parameters
- Coordinate grid and axes visualization
- Real-time position feedback

## Technical Benefits

Setting up OpenGL on modern macOS systems presents several challenges, particularly on Apple Silicon. This project addresses these issues through:

- Automatic architecture detection (Intel vs Apple Silicon)
- Appropriate GLFW library selection based on system architecture
- Comprehensive dependency management
- Simplified build configuration

## Dependencies

- OpenGL
- GLFW 3
- CMake (3.0 or higher)
- C++ compiler with C++14 support

## Quick Installation

### Complete Setup Command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kust1011/opengl-quickstart.git && cd opengl-quickstart && ./scripts/install.sh
```

### Step-by-Step Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/kust1011/opengl-quickstart.git
cd opengl-quickstart

# Run the installation script
./scripts/install.sh
```

The installation process:
1. Verifies and installs required dependencies
2. Detects your Mac's architecture (Intel vs Apple Silicon)
3. Downloads and configures the appropriate GLFW version
4. Sets up the build environment
5. Compiles the application

During installation, you will be prompted to select:

- A C++ compiler if none is found (options for Homebrew Clang or Xcode Command Line Tools)
- GLFW setup method (manual download or automatic installation)

### Manual Installation

For advanced users who prefer manual configuration, detailed instructions are available in the [Installation Guide](docs/INSTALL.md).

## Usage

After building, run the application:

```bash
cd build
./OpenGLScene
```

### Controls

- **Camera Movement**:
  - W - Move forward (−Z)
  - S - Move backward (+Z)
  - A - Move left (−X)
  - D - Move right (+X)
  - Space - Move up (+Y)
  - Shift - Move down (−Y)

- **Object Movement**:
  - I - Move forward (−Z)
  - K - Move backward (+Z)
  - J - Move left (−X)
  - L - Move right (+X)

- **Application Control**:
  - Q - Exit application
